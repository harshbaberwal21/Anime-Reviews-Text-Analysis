# Anime-Reviews-Analysis
### Text Mining - Academic Project



## Description

The anime viewership is growing at an ever-increasing pace. Widespread streaming platforms such as Netflix have taken a huge interest in anime. With increasing number of new anime, catering to everyone’s interests, the anime viewership is increasing a lot each year. This along with the success and popularity of the AT&T owned anime streaming platform, Crunchyroll, the industry is growing bigger at a fast pace. Today Netflix houses not only mainstream anime but also launches the up-and-coming anime to maintain the interest of viewers. With this budding popularity and growing market size, it is important to understand what the audience is looking for in anime and what sets them off about it.



## Problem Overview
In this project, we tend to use the viewer’s reviews and study them to identify what anime characteristics do people appreciate most significantly (through positive reviews) and what others they find crucial to be improved (through negative reviews). To carry out this research, action and romance are chosen to be the two genres being studied. The rationale behind it is that these are two of the most reviewed genres and are the most distinct from each other compared to others. Moreover, the compatibility of our data and research question restricted us to use these two genres.


## Data Overview
The reviews being studied are scraped from the myanimelist.com website that houses the anime community and discussions around multiple anime. The data contains 3 files; reviews, anime and profile. Reviews dataset has the reviews text aloing with anime-id and review-id. The anime dataset contains anime metadata such as anime genre.


## Project Focus
While the project focuses on solving the problem at hand, a major focus was equipping myself with the necessary skills to work on text data and build efficient end-to-end mining/predictive frameworks on text data, since it was an academic project. This also resulted out of the dataset limitations, which was mainly chosen because of my interest in anime. Further, additional work is required to improve this process, especially on the data quality and pre-processing front.
Further, with this data and nature of text-processing process, this project was carried out as a one time activity and would require multiple changes to cater to a different dataset.


## Output Overview
The primary output of this exercise are wordclouds (with importance weighted size) for positive/negative reviews for both the genres. 
With better data quality and additional efforts directed towards data cleaning and processing, other forms of the output could be computed depending upon the use case.
