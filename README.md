# Anime-Reviews-Analysis
### Text Mining - Academic Project


## Intention
In this project, we tend to use the viewerâ€™s reviews and analyze them to identify what anime characteristics do people appreciate the most (through positive reviews) and what others they find crucial to be improved (through negative reviews). To carry out this research, action and romance are chosen to be the two genres to be studied. The rationale behind it is that these are two of the most reviewed genres and are the most distinct from each other in terms of content compared to others. Moreover, the compatibility of our data and research question restricted us to using these two genres.  


## Data
The reviews being studied are scraped from myanimelist.com website that houses the anime community and discussions around multiple anime. The data contains 3 files,
- reviews: reviews text along with anime-id and review-id
- anime: Anime metadata such as anime genre etc.
- profile: Users' metadata


## Output Overview
The primary output of this exercise are wordclouds (with importance-weighted size) for positive/negative reviews for both the genres. 
With better data quality other forms of the output could be computed depending upon the use case.  

Below is a wordcloud of the most appreciated characteristics of anime of action genre.
